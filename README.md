# JS Fundamentals in 30 days

## Description

This is a 30 days of JavaScript programming language challenge aimed at helping myself get a better understanding of some important but easily confused concepts. I will be covering the following topics (please note that topics may change):

- Day 1: Type conversion vs. Type coercion
- Day 2: Variables and Constants
- Day 3: Execution Context
- Day 4: Scope
- Day 5: Closure

I also published these articles on [medium](https://medium.com/@shan32157).
